      <h2>My professional life ...</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Sonia Wu. I can’t believe I am in school again! 28 years ago, when I received  my master of 
        Computer Science degree, I thought I would say good bye to school forever.

        After working in the telecom software development for 20+ years, early this year, the company 
        I worked for decided to outsource our department to the other country. I could have taken this opportunity 
        to retire. For all these years, my hand on experience was limited to telecom software development. 
        Falling behind the new internet technology. I decide to go back to school catch up. When I told my kids 
        my decision, they were so happy. They thought they could track my grades on quiz, mid-term and final, 
        like what I did to them. Thanks for Professor Stolley! We don’t do any test. My kids are disappointed!
